# TNBC-Signature-MetaAnalysis
A comprehensive, cross-platform framework for benchmarking published prognostic gene signatures and discovering robust multi-gene risk models in triple-negative breast cancer using multi-cohort RNA-seq and microarray data.
This repository provides a reproducible analytical framework for the systematic evaluation of published prognostic gene signatures in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) across multiple independent transcriptomic cohorts.

It implements harmonized scoring, quality control, and meta-analysis strategies for both RNA-seq and microarray datasets, enabling robust cross-study comparisons. In addition, the pipeline supports the derivation of novel multi-gene prognostic signatures using survival-based feature selection, penalized Cox regression, master regulator inference (ARACNe–VIPER), and single-cell integration (Scissor), facilitating biologically interpretable and clinically relevant risk stratification in TNBC.
